 * to uint64_t; the guest sends it as the wire object_id and the host
 * recovers the original pointer via npt_object_from_id.
 *
 * Dual refcount: pub_ref is what AddRef/Release expose to the app;
 * priv_ref is the runtime's internal hold (in-flight RPCs, parent
 * coupling).  Destruction only happens when both reach zero.  A child
 * wrapper holds a priv_ref on its parent for the child's entire wrapper
 * lifetime, including while pub_ref is zero but private holds keep it alive.
